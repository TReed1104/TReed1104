# Welcome!
My names Tom, and I work as a Software Engineer and Computer Technician in Higher Education.

My current role mainly focuses on writing tools and websites to improve the workflow and support provided by my team. Most importantly I get to choose the frameworks and tech to use meaning I get to keep up to date with current and new industry standards.

Outside of work I do the odd bit of game dev and WoW Addon dev.
